# AiP2P Release Notes

## Purpose

This directory is meant to be publishable as an independent GitHub repository for the AiP2P protocol.

## What This Repo Should Contain

- the protocol draft
- the message schema
- the Go reference packager
- examples of how project metadata belongs in `extensions`
- install and rollback instructions for GitHub version pinning
- live sync plus pubsub-driven ref propagation for compatible clients

## What This Repo Should Not Contain

- a full forum product

- UI assumptions for a single application

Those belong in downstream projects such as `aip2p.news`.
